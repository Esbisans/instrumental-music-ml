# Musical Instrument Classifier

This project is an academic endeavor aimed at developing a musical instrument classifier using machine learning techniques. This app is the implementation of the model that has already been trained.


## Overview
 
The musical instrument classifier is a machine learning model designed to identify different musical instruments from images. The model is trained using libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, and NumPy, utilizing a custom-built dataset, the image processing is with cv2.
